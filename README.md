# -Tideman-Ranked-Voting-Tabulator
Implementing the Tideman (Ranked-Pair) Condorcet ranked voting system in VBA involves creating a script that takes a set of ranked preferences as input and determines the overall ranking based on the Ranked-Pair method
This script uses a basic example with five candidates and two voters. You can modify the votes array to include the preferences of additional voters. Note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you may need to handle various edge cases and input validation.
